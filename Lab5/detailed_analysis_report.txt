ANALYSIS REPORT: Phrase Extraction and alignment symmetrization

1. PHRASE EXTRACTION IMPLEMENTATION

The phrase extractor follows the standard consistent phrase extraction algorithm:
- For each possible English phrase span, find aligned Romanian words
- Determine minimal Romanian span covering these alignments  
- Apply consistency constraints:
  * No English words inside align to Romanian words outside
  * No Romanian words inside align to English words outside


2. SYMMETRIZATION STRATEGY

Instead of simple intersection/union, a multi-stage approach was used:

Stage 1: Strong Intersection
- Keep only points present in both alignment directions
- High precision but often too sparse for good phrase coverage

Stage 2: Neighbor Expansion
- Add points adjacent to intersection points
- Captures nearby reliable alignments that GIZA++ might have missed

Stage 3: One-to-One Completion  
- Add points that create clean 1:1 word mappings
- Resolves cases where both directions suggest unique mappings

Stage 4: Gap Filling
- Add points that fill gaps between strong alignments
- Creates more contiguous phrasal units

3. KEY FINDINGS BY SENTENCE

Mermaid Example:
- ENG<-RO had sparse alignments with many NULL mappings and cases where one English word aligned to multiple Romanian words.
  As a result, several linguistically implausible phrase pairs were extracted:
- RO<-ENG provided better lexical coverage

Cat Example:
- ENG<-RO missed several functional word alignments
- RO<-ENG captured more syntactic relationships
- Symmetrization created more meaningful phrasal units

Michael Example:
- Different alignment patterns for verb phrases
- ENG<-RO collapsed multiple Romanian words to single English word
- RO<-ENG provided better distribution
- Symmetrization balanced both approaches

4. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS

Challenge 1: Sparse vs Dense Alignments
- Solution: Used neighbor expansion to bridge gaps

Challenge 2: NULL Alignment Proliferation
- Solution: Used one-to-one completion to recover likely mappings

5. CONCLUSION

The enhanced symmetrization strategy successfully combines the strengths of both alignment directions while maintaining phrase consistency. The results show improvements in phrase coverage while preserving alignment quality.
The approach demonstrates that careful, multi-stage symmetrization can substantially improve the utility of GIZA++ alignments for phrase-based machine translation.
