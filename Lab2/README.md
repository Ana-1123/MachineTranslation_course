Create a simple word-by-word translation system. Use the lexicon from the file lexicon.txt and 
the rules from the file rules.txt. Your system should be able to correctly translate the following 
examples, or similar ones, received from the user: 
Mary reads a book. 
A book is under the table. 
Mary cut the sugar cane with a saw. 
Mary cut the sugar cane and is happy. 
The woman with a red cane saw a cat under the table and walks to the cat. 
Deliver the system, with a 1 page description.
